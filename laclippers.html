					<h1>LA Clippers</h1>
						<p>
							For most of their history the Los Angeles Clippers have been synonymous with losing. In all of the major sports in the United States, the Clippers along with maybe four other teams were the embodiment of failure. The franchise began in the 1970 as the Buffalo Braves. The Braves had some success for the years they were in Buffalo. They qualified for the playoffs numerous times, and they won some playoff series. After eight seasons in Buffalo, the franchise moved to San Diego and took on the new name Clippers. It is at this point in which the Clippers came into existence as the shameful team they have been known to be. For thirteen years, they failed to make the playoffs or win half of their games.
						</p>

						<p>
							In 1984, the Clippers moved from San Diego to Los Angeles. They now shared the city with one of the most storied teams in NBA history: the Lakers. It was a bit ironic that the same city had one of the best and one of the worst teams in history. Eventually the two teams shared the same arena for home games.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Clippers have only made the playoffs a few times, and they have won few series in the playoffs. They have never won an NBA championship, nor have they made it to the Finals.
						</p>

						<p>
							There is only one good thing about the Clippers. That is the present. In 2009, the Clippers selected Blake Griffin with the first pick in the NBA draft. Griffin was a much anticipated player entering the NBA. He was an athletic power forward that threw down powerful dunks. However, in typical Clipper fashion, Griffin was hurt in the preseason before his rookie year, and he did not play a single game that season.
						</p>

						<p>
							Coming into the 2010-2011 season, the Clippers had to look forward to the return of Blake Griffin. There were a few promising young players other than Griffin such as defensive minded center DeAndre Jordan and Eric Gordon who was beginning to develop into a fine point guard. The Clippers finished 32-50 which was not a great record, but it was mainly behind the good play of their youngster as veteran leaders Baron Davis and Chris Kaman were hurt frequently.
						</p>

						<p>
							In that season Blake Griffin won rookie of the year, and he instantly became one of the best dunkers in NBA history. Griffin would often have one of the best highlights of the night in the NBA with an impressive dunk. He was the first rookie to be in the All-Star game in over a decade. The Clippers were on the rise.
						<p>
							The offseason put the Clippers on the map as a playoff team and a title contender. Their young players were another year better, and they acquired four prior all stars in the offseason. The Clippers parted with some of their young talent to get Chris Paul who is considered the best point guard in the NBA. They also got Caron Butler to join their team as well as former NBA champion and leader Chauncey Billups.
						</p>

						<p>
							This team immediately became a fan favorite. They were given the nickname “Lob City” for all of the anticipated lob passes for dunks from Chris Paul to Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. To start the NBA season in 2011-2012, the Clippers have not let the fans down. Blake Griffin has had countless highlight film dunks, and Chris Paul has helped bring a winning atmosphere to the Clippers. The Clippers are on pace to make the playoffs as one of the top four seeds, and they are one of the most entertaining teams in the NBA to watch along with the Miami Heat. The sky is the limit for this team.
