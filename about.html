					<h1>About this website</h1>
						<p>
							This website was made as a personal project to help expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The information written for the NBA teams were taken from another website just to fill up the spaces. Hopefully, this website is able to function and meets all requirements of any basic website.
						</p>

						<p>
							I hope the users were able to enjoy the content and able to learn much about their favorite teams' or even opposing teams' histories and backgrounds.
						</p>

						<p>
							If you have any questions or even ideas that can help this website flourish even more, feel free to contact me by filling out the information below.
