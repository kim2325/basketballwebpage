					<h1>Boston Celtics</h1>
						<p>
							Established in 1946 by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation President Walter A. Darker, as a major aspect of the BAA (Basketball Association of America), the Boston Celtics as of now play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Division. With a record 17 NBA title rings, they are the best NBA establishment ever just as a standout amongst the most predominant group in all of games. Their life span, achievement and diligent hard working attitude have added to making them a standout amongst the most notorious groups in American games.
						</p>

						<h4>Irish Spririt</h4>
						<p>
							It was proprietor Walter A. Dark colored who thought of the name "Boston Celtics". The "Original Celtics" a New York-based ball crew had been inconceivably prevailing during the 1920s and Brown felt the name would convey the fitting weight while speaking to the vast Massachusetts Irish people group. He likewise chose to embrace the conventional Irish shades of green and white, that regardless they wear today. A legend was conceived.
						</p>

						<h4>The Uniforms</h4>
						<p>
							Since the introduction of the establishment, the Boston players have been wearing green shirts and shorts with white accents for away amusements and white outfits with green trims at home. The name "Boston" was shown on the facade of the pullovers for the initial two NBA seasons before it was supplanted by "Celtics" in 1951.
						</p>

						<p>
							All the more as of late, with the expanding impact of showcasing and authorized items deals, "alternate" jerseys and outfits have been worn on events. Some incorporate dark trims rather than the conventional white ones with "Boston" supplanting the name of the club. Since 2007, the players incidentally wear gold-cut garbs that were first utilized as a major aspect of St Patrick's Day festivities.

						<h4>The Logos</h4>
						<p>
							The logo showing a Leprechaun spinning a basketball was first designed by Zang, Red Auerbach’s brother, in the late 1960s. Even if it has undergone a few changes and tweaks, it still remains the Celtics’ main logo today. The previous one, used throughout the 1950s, featured a crowned Leprechaun cheering.<br/>
							A green shamrock was the original 1949 logo and is still used today as an alternate.
						</p>

						<h4>The Venues</h4>
						<p>
							Even if the team’s first home game was actually played at the Boston Arena, it is the Boston Madison Square Garden (known as the Boston Garden), a 15,000-seat arena inaugurated in 1928, which is widely regarded as the original Celtics’ home court. The venue, which featured the signature parquet floor, was destroyed in 1997.<br/>
							Since 1995, the Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden (formally known as the FleetCenter and TD Banknorth Garden). The arena that sits almost 19,000 is located at 100 Legends Way in downtown, Boston and has a parquet floor reminiscent of the original Garden’s. The venue is also home to the hockey team Boston Bruins.
						</p>

						<h4>A Legend in the Making – Difficult Beginnings (1949-1956)</h4>
						<p>
							The rich history of the Boston Celtics is closely linked to that of one man in particular, legendary coach, General Manager and club president Arnold “Red” Auerbach.<br/>
							After a somewhat disastrous 1949-50 season, owner Walter A. Brown was looking for a coach to help build a truly competitive team in what were the early days of the NBA. At the time, the coach was responsible for all aspects of basketball operations, from team practices to the recruitment of players. Brown hired Auerbach, who had coached the US Navy team during WWII, on April 27th, 1950, just days before the draft. The new coach immediately set out to build a fast-pace offense and fast-break-oriented team around center Ed Macauley, forward Bones McKinney and point guard and local star Bob Cousy. As a result, the Celtics made the playoffs for the first time ever but lost in the Division semi-finals to the New York Knicks.<br/>
							The following year, Bill Sharman, Frank Ramsey and Jim Loscutoff were added to the roster. Unfortunately, and despite another good season, the Celtics fell again to the Knicks in the playoffs. The same scenario would happen again for the five next years, with the team making the playoffs every year but failing to reach the finals.<br/>
							After another heartbreaking loss in the 1956 playoffs, Auerbach felt that they needed a player to reinforce their defense, a center who would get more rebounds and help initiate fast-breaks. That’s when he stunned the League by trading bona fide star center Macaulay for a draft pick with which he selected University of San Francisco rebounding and defensive big man Bill Russell.
						</p>

						<h4>The Domination (1956-1969) of Celtics</h4>
						<p>
							The acquisition of Russell, 1957 Rookie of the Year forward Tommy Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, both future Hall-of-Famers, immediately paid off and worked wonders with Auerbach’s new defense-first philosophy. For the first time in their history, the Celtics made the Finals and went on to defeat the St Louis Hawks to claim their first ever NBA Championship. After barely missing on back to back titles, when falling to the Hawks in the 1958 Finals, the Celtics came back roaring, winning the next eight NBA titles in a row, a record that still holds today.<br/>
							Coach Auerbach retired at the end of 1965-66 season, and Bill Russell took over as head coach while still playing with the team. The Celtics uncharacteristically lost in the Eastern Division Finals on his first season but managed to add two more NBA titles, in 1968 and 1969, gathering 11 titles in 13 seasons, an unparalleled record in any American professional sports. Today, the 1960s Celtics are widely viewed as one of the most dominant teams of all time.
						</p>

						<h4>The 1970s</h4>
						<p>
							Bill Russell retired in 1969, both as a player and a coach, and for the first time in over a decade, the 1969-70 season was a losing one for the Celtics who failed to make the playoffs. The time had come to rebuild. The acquisition of center Dave Cowens (drafted in 1970), forward Paul Silas (traded in 1972) and guard Jo Jo White (drafted in 1969) allowed them to quickly become dominant again. Auerbach, now general manager, hired former player Tom Heinsohn as the new head coach and after losing in the Conference Finals in 1972 and 1973, the C’s captured their 12th and 13th championships in 1974 and 1976.<br/>
							In 1978, the Celtics’ all-time leading scorer John Havlicek, retired and new owner John Y. Brown worked out a trade to have Bob McAdoo replace him with the team. This caused a dispute with Auerbach, who was firmly opposed to the move, and almost resigned over it. Rather than incur the anger of Bostonians, who massively supported the former head coach, Brown chose to step down and sold the team.
						</p>

						<h4>The Big Three (1979-1992)</h4>
						<p>
							With a new owner in place, Auerbach had the opportunity to make a series of decisive moves. He traded McAdoo away, built a solid backcourt consisting of M.L Carr, Tiny Archibald and Gerald Henderson, and drafted college star Larry Bird. The next year, he acquired center Robert Parish from Golden State and drafted University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale. What would go on to be known as the Big 3 was born. Everything was set for the Celtics to dominate the league once again and under head coach Bill Fitch, they captured their 14th title in 1981 by defeating the Houston Rockets. But success was short-lived. They lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Conference Finals in ‘82 and were swept by the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round in ’83. This caused Fitch to resign and the team to be sold to new owners led by Dan Gaston.
							Under new coach and former player K.C Jones, the C’s immediately got back to the Finals in 1984 in which they defeated Magic Johnson’s Lakers for their 15th championship. Auerbach retired as General Manager but remained Team President and appointed Jan Volk as his replacement. In 1985, the men in green met again with the Lakers in the Finals, but this time L.A prevailed, for the first time ever against Boston.
							The following season, the Celtics were back with a vengeance. They had acquired Bill Walton, an excellent passing center, in the offseason and posted an impressive 67-15 record on the season. They won their 16th championship against the Houston Rockets, while Bird was named NBA MVP for the third time in a row and Walton earned the 6th Man of the Year honors. This 1985-85 roster has been voted in as one of the ten best teams in NBA history.<br/>
							But in spite of all their talent, success was about to elude the Celtics for the next 22 years. The Big 3 were getting old and Bird starting being pestered by injuries. In the 1986 Draft, the Celtics selected University of Maryland star Len Bias, hoping the young man who fans viewed as the next superstar would ensure the future of the franchise. Unfortunately, Bias passed away just two days after the draft of cocaine overdose. In 1987, the Celtics still managed to make the NBA Finals but lost to the Lakers for the second time. They wouldn’t return to the Finals for 21 years. They made it to the Eastern Conference for the last time in 1988, losing to the Detroit Pistons’ Bad Boys. The rest of Larry Bird’s career was plagued by injuries and back pains and he eventually retired in 1992, after winning the gold medal in the Barcelona Olympics with the “Dream Team”. The Big 3 era ended for good in 1994, when Kevin McHale retired and Robert Parish went to play with the Charlotte Hornets.
						</p>

						<h4>The Drought (1993-2007)</h4>
						<p>
							After Reggie Lewis’ untimely death in 1993, a promising small forward that many viewed as Bird’s successor as the face of the franchise, the Celtics entered the gloomiest period of their history. In 1994, a starting line-up consisting of 35-year-old Dominique Wilkins, Dee Brown, Croatian Dino Radja, Sherman Douglas and rookie Eric Montross barely made the playoffs and was swept in the first round by Shaq O’Neal’s Orlando Magic. Things kept going downhill, the team losing a record 67 games in the 1996-97 season. The hiring of star college coach Rick Pitino as club president, director of basketball operations and head coach in 1997 did little to better the situation. The team failed to make the playoffs six seasons in a row. Paul Pierce, drafted in 1998, had developed into a star but was lacking support. Pitino resigned in 2001 and Jim O’Brien got the head coaching job, leading the team to their first playoff appearance since 1995. They lost to the New Jersey Nets in the Conference Finals.<br/>
							In 2003, Paul Gaston sold the team to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C. who hired Danny Ainge as General Manager, who in turn hired Doc Rivers as the new head coach. In spite of all the positive changes, Boston would still have to wait until 2007 to find their way back to success.
						</p>

						<h4>The second Big 3 and Big 4 (2007-today)</h4>
						<p>
							In 2007, Danny Ainge made a series of moves that would finally bring success back to Beantown. He had already drafted point guard Rajon Rondo in 2006, and traded several of his role players to acquire All-star Ray Allen and rookie PF Glen Davis from Seattle and former MVP Kevin Garnett from Minnesota. The association of Paul Pierce, Allen and Garnett instantly developed into a new Big Three, especially with Garnett bringing new defensive, hard-work ethic to the team. After the best single-season turnaround in NBA history (they improved by 24 wins), the Celtics reached the NBA Finals and defeated their nemesis Los Angeles Lakers in 6 games. The following season, they posted an impressive 62-20 record but lost Garnett to injury for the playoffs and had to give in to the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals.</p>
							<p>In 2009, Garnett was back, center Kendrick Perkins had blossomed into a real presence in the paint and Boston went straight back to the NBA Finals, meeting once again with the Los Angeles Lakers. Rajon Rondo really emerged as an All-Star during post-season but the purple and gold ultimately prevailed after coming back from 13 points down in Game 7.</p>
							<p>The addition of former All-stars Shaquille O’Neal and Jermaine O’Neal in 2010 had little impact as the two accumulated injuries and poor performances throughout the season. Doc Rivers’ men were eliminated from the playoffs by the Miami Heat in the second round with Shaq playing very little and retiring at the end of the season.</p>
							They entered the 2011-12 season with a starting line-up of Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Jermaine O’Neal.
						</p>

						<h4>The Legacy</h4>
						<p>
							Having won 17 championships, the Boston Celtics are one of the better-known and most supported sport franchises in the world. They’re also among the most hated ones, the players having often been criticized in the 1960s and again the 1980s for being arrogant trash-talkers. Today, they are widely viewed as a hard-working, albeit aging team.
							The Celtics were the first franchise to draft an African-American, Chuck Cooper, and also the first to line up an all-black starting five consisting of Bill Russell, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones, Tom Sanders and Willie Naulls in the mid-60s.
							<p>The attendance, despite being very low in the early beginnings (around 2,000 per game in the first year of Red Auerbach’s tenure as head coach) broke the 10,000 average mark twice, during the 1956-57 and 1966-67 seasons. From the 1972-73 season on, the average attendance regularly hovered above 10,000 until reaching full capacity (15,000) in Larry Bird’s rookie season.</p>
							<p>Since the Celtics have been playing in the TD Garden (1995), the average attendance has fluctuated between 17,000 and 18,000. For the first time in decades, all the home games of the 2007-08 season were sold out.</p>
							The Boston Celtics are a legendary organization and their recent success has put them firmly back on the NBA map, where fans hope they will remain for a long time.
